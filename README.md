I am a **Data Analyst** who is passionate about transforming data into meaningful insights and visuals that drive better decisions.  



## About Me

My curiosity for how things work led me to study Mechanical Engineering, where I learned to approach problems with structure, logic, and precision. That same mindset now drives my passion for data analysis in uncovering insights and patterns that guide better decisions.



## What I Do

I mainly work with **Microsoft Excel**, **Power BI**, and **Python** to:  
- 📊 Design clean and insightful dashboards and reports  
- 🧹 Collect, clean, and analyze data to uncover trends and patterns  
- 💡 Help individuals and organizations make informed, data-driven decisions  

I also have **Beginner SQL skills** and enjoy learning through hands-on projects that strengthen my analytical thinking.  

As a lifelong learner, I love simplifying complex data concepts into clear, practical outcomes that others can understand and apply.
