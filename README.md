-[FINANCIAL DISTRESS PREDICTION](https://github.com/Tabitha001/MACHINE-LEARNING-PORTFOLIO/tree/main/FINANCIAL%20DISTRESS%20PREDICTION):A Case Study on Anticipating Economic Hardship in companies and Institutions

The goal of this case study is to create a reliable financial distress prediction model that can predict financial difficulty in businesses and institutions. Financial distress is an immense concern for organizations and businesses all over the world, frequently resulting in insolvency, bankruptcy, or extremely difficult economic conditions. Early warning indications of financial trouble can have a substantial impact on decision-making and help avoid negative outcomes. In order to create a trustworthy model that may predict financial difficulty and assist stakeholders in making wise decisions, this case study looks into historical financial data as well as other pertinent economic indicators.
This study tries to uncover early warning signals of financial distress, assisting stakeholders, investors, and policymakers in taking proactive measures to mitigate potential risks. It does this by utilizing historical financial data, key performance indicators, and macroeconomic variables. To build a strong prediction framework, the project includesÂ data preparation, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
