-[FINANCIAL DISTRESS PREDICTION](https://github.com/Tabitha001/MACHINE-LEARNING-PORTFOLIO/tree/main/FINANCIAL%20DISTRESS%20PREDICTION):A Case Study on Anticipating Economic Hardship in companies and Institutions

The goal of this case study is to create a reliable financial distress prediction model that can predict financial difficulty in businesses and institutions. Financial distress is an immense concern for organizations and businesses all over the world, frequently resulting in insolvency, bankruptcy, or extremely difficult economic conditions. Early warning indications of financial trouble can have a substantial impact on decision-making and help avoid negative outcomes. In order to create a trustworthy model that may predict financial difficulty and assist stakeholders in making wise decisions, this case study looks into historical financial data as well as other pertinent economic indicators.
This study tries to uncover early warning signals of financial distress, assisting stakeholders, investors, and policymakers in taking proactive measures to mitigate potential risks. It does this by utilizing historical financial data, key performance indicators, and macroeconomic variables. To build a strong prediction framework, the project includes data preparation, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.


-[OPTIMIZING TERM DEPOSIT SUBSCRIPTIONS IN DIRECT MARKETING CAMPAIGNS](https://github.com/Tabitha001/MACHINE-LEARNING-PORTFOLIO/tree/main/OPTIMIZING%20TERM%20DEPOSIT%20SUBSCRIPTIONS%20IN%20DIRECT%20MARKETING%20CAMPAIGNS): A Case Study with a Portuguese Banking Institution 

Direct marketing campaigns play a crucial role in promoting financial products, such as term deposits, to potential customers. However, a one-size-fits-all approach often leads to suboptimal results and resource wastage. This case study seeks to address this issue by applying data-driven insights and machine learning to target the right customers with personalized offers, ultimately increasing term deposit subscriptions and maximizing the campaign's return on investment.
The goal of the study is to develop an effective approach for detecting potential customers who are likely to sign up for term deposits using machine learning techniques and customer data. To create a data-driven strategy that maximizes the campaign's success rate and enhances the bank's overall marketing strategy by examining past campaign data, consumer demographics, and behavioral trends.
